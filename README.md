# Sprint 7 project

## Project Description

This project is designed to test your knowledge and skills in JavaScript by working with GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests. The project involves creating and executing tests for various API endpoints provided by the Urban Grocers server. You will write tests to check the response status codes and validate the response bodies to ensure they contain the expected data.

## Documentation Source

The documentation for the API endpoints used in this project is generated using [apiDoc](https://apidocjs.com/). You can access the documentation at `{server URL}/docs/` after starting the Urban Grocers server.

## Technologies and Techniques Used

- **JavaScript**: The main programming language used to write the tests.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment for executing code.
- **npm**: Node package manager used to install project dependencies.
- **Jest**: JavaScript testing framework used for writing and running tests.
- **Git and GitHub**: Version control system and platform for hosting the project repository.
- **VS Code**: Recommended text editor for writing code and managing the project files.

### How to Run the Tests

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/hm07-qa-us.git
   cd hm07-qa-us
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
